# Xopp File Mover

.xopp is the file format of the handwriting tool xournal++(https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp) and stores
the annotated pdfs seperate from the .xopp files.
To reduce my headache, with synced directorys, this little script will save the pdf background in the same directory as the .xopp
file associated with them (hidden).
